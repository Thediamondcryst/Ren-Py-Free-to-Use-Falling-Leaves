# Ren-Py-Free-to-Use-Falling-Leaves
A free to use project for falling leaves, complete with many different tree leaves types, just copy the images and script file, type the appropriate image names and enjoy!

## Contributing
Any code updates are appreciated. Images should follow the flat and intentional art style.

To edit a picture, draw the leaf/leaves, reduce the pixel size to around 10~15 pixels, and commit.
